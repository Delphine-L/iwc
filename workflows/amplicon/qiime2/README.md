# QIIME2 workflows

## TODOs

- The import workflows for multiplexed data currently first convert the metadata into qza and require the user to enter a column as free text. If Galaxy allows for data-column workflow parameters this step can be removed.

## Available workflows

1. Import of fastq.gz data into QIIME artifact files. Available for
   - paired / single end data
   - demultiplexed / multiplexed data (the later according to the EMP protocol)
   For data that is multiplexed with another protocol the cutadapt tool can be use.
2. Denoising
   - paired / single end data
