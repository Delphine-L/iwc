# MatchMS Library Processing and Chemoinformatics Workflow

This workflow is designed for processing spectral libraries and performing chemoinformatics analyses using the MatchMS library. It enables users to clean, filter, and annotate spectral data, making it suitable for downstream metabolomics analyses.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Spectral Data Cleaning**:
   - Removes noise and irrelevant peaks from the spectral data.
   - Ensures the data is in a standardized format for further processing.

2. **Spectral Filtering**:
   - Filters spectra based on user-defined criteria such as intensity thresholds or peak counts.

3. **Spectral Annotation**:
   - Annotates spectra with metadata, including compound names, chemical formulas, and other relevant information.

4. **Chemoinformatics Analysis**:
   - Performs similarity searches and clustering of spectra.
   - Generates insights into the chemical space represented by the spectral library.

## Inputs

- **Spectral Library**: A file containing the spectral data in a supported format (e.g., MGF, MSP).
- **Filtering Parameters**: User-defined criteria for filtering spectra.
- **Annotation Metadata**: Optional metadata file for annotating spectra.

## Outputs

- **Cleaned Spectral Library**: A processed version of the input spectral library with noise removed.
- **Filtered Spectral Library**: A subset of the cleaned library based on filtering criteria.
- **Annotated Spectral Library**: A library with added metadata annotations.
- **Analysis Reports**: Summary reports and visualizations of the chemoinformatics analyses.

## Usage

This workflow is designed to be run on the Galaxy platform. Users can upload their spectral data, configure the parameters, and execute the workflow to obtain processed and annotated spectral libraries.
