Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) is a mass spectrometry technique widely used in proteomics to analyze complex protein mixtures. It allows for the simultaneous acquisition of fragmentation data from all detectable peptides within a sample, making it highly suitable for quantitative and comprehensive proteomic analyses. DIA processing tools are specialized software packages designed to handle the large volumes of data generated by DIA experiments, identifying and quantifying peptides and proteins in a robust and reproducible manner. EncyclopeDIA can use spectral libraries to identify and quantify peptides in DIA data. A spectral library is a collection of previously identified peptide spectra that serve as references for matching new data. This method enhances the sensitivity and specificity of peptide identification. Additionally, EncyclopeDIA supports a library-free workflow, where it generates in-silico spectral libraries from protein sequences and searches the DIA data directly against these predicted spectra. EncyclopeDIA stands out in the field of DIA proteomics due to its versatility, robust performance, and integration capabilities. It has been used in the fields of clincal proteomics, microbial proteomics and functional proteomics. As an open-source project, EncyclopeDIA benefits from contributions from the proteomics research community. It is actively maintained and updated to incorporate the latest advancements in DIA methodology and mass spectrometry technology. This continuous development ensures that the software remains a cutting-edge tool for DIA data analysis.

In this current workflow, we perform Quantification using the EncyclopeDIA tool. A GTN has been developed for this workflow.
