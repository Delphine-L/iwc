# VGP Workflow #2

This workflow performs a phased assembly using Hifi Pacbio dta.

## VGP Pipeline

The Collaboration between the [VGP](https://vertebrategenomesproject.org/) lead to the creation of a set of workflows dedicated to hybrid genome assembly. The pipeline inclide de following workflows:
-   Creation of kmer count histograms with Meryl
-   Hifi Long Read phased assembly with Hifiasm
-   Scaffolding with Bionano Mapping data (Optional)
-   Scaffolding with HiC data
